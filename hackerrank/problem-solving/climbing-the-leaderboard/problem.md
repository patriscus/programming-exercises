Difficulty: Medium

An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, 
so its leaderboard works like this:

- The player with the highest score is ranked number  on the leaderboard.
- Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.

### Example
`ranked = [100, 90, 90, 80]`

`player = [70, 80, 105]`

The ranked players will have ranks 1, 2, 2, and 3, respectively. If the 
player's scores are 70, 80 and 105, their rankings after each game 
are 4th, 3rd and 1st. Return `[4, 3, 1]`.

### Function Description

climbingLeaderboard has the following parameter(s):

- int ranked[n]: the leaderboard scores
- int player[m]: the player's scores

Returns

- int[m]: the player's rank after each new score
