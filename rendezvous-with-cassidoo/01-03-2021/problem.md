Given a room size, and the square footage a paint can can cover, return how many cans of paint you need to buy to paint a room. Assume the room has four walls. If youâ€™d like to expand this, you can add doors, windows, 
or any other room features that might make the problem interesting to solve.

Example:

```text
room = { length: 12, width: 10, height: 9 }
canCoverage = 200

$ numberOfCans(room, canCoverage)
$ 2 // (12*9*2)+(10*9*2) = 396, so two cans will cover it
```
