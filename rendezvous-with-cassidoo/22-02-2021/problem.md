Given a string `str` containing only the characters `x` and `y`, change it into a string such that there are no matching 
adjacent characters. Youâ€™re allowed to delete zero or more characters in the 
string. Find the minimum number of required deletions.

Example:
```js
everyOther('xxyxxy')
2 // str becomes 'xyxy'

everyOther('yyyyy')
4 // str becomes 'y'
```
