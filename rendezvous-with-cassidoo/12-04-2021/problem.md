Given an array of 0s and 1s that represent a garden, where 0 is a plot that hasnâ€™t been planted on, and 1 is a plot that has been planted on, return true if n plants can be planted without touching another plant.

Example:

```text
garden = [1,0,0,0,1]
canPlant(garden, 1) // true

canPlant(garden, 4) // false
```
